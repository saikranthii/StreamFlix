We collect various types of personal data to provide a personalized and seamless experience for our users. This includes, but is not limited to, email addresses, user preferences, browsing history, search queries, and interaction data such as clicks and time spent on specific content. We may also collect demographic information, such as age or location, if voluntarily provided by users during account creation or profile updates. All data collection is conducted with explicit user consent, obtained through clear and accessible opt-in mechanisms. Users are informed about the purpose of data collection at the point of entry, ensuring full transparency.\n\n              Our data collection practices adhere strictly to global privacy regulations, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United States. We ensure that users have the right to access, rectify, or delete their personal data at any time. Requests for data access or deletion are processed promptly, typically within 30 days, as required by law. We also provide users with the ability to opt out of non-essential data collection, such as targeted recommendations, through account settings. Users can manage their privacy preferences at any time, and changes are applied immediately.\n\n              To protect user data, we implement robust security measures. All personal information is encrypted both in transit (using SSL/TLS protocols) and at rest (using AES-256 encryption). Access to personal data is restricted to authorized personnel only, and all employees undergo regular training on data protection best practices. We conduct periodic security audits to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities. In the unlikely event of a data breach, we have a comprehensive incident response plan to notify affected users and regulatory authorities promptly, in compliance with applicable laws.\n\n              We do not share personal data with third parties for marketing purposes without explicit user consent. Any data shared with trusted partners, such as cloud service providers or analytics platforms, is anonymized to prevent identification of individual users. For example, we may share aggregated data (e.g., “80% of users prefer action movies”) to improve our services or conduct market research, but this data cannot be linked to specific individuals. Users can revoke consent for data sharing at any time through their account settings.\n\n              Our platform also respects user rights to data portability. Users can request a copy of their personal data in a structured, machine-readable format, enabling them to transfer it to another service if desired. We do not engage in automated decision-making or profiling that produces legal or significant effects on users without human oversight. For users under 16 (or the applicable age of consent in their jurisdiction), we require parental consent for data collection, verified through secure methods.\n\n              We are committed to minimizing data collection to what is strictly necessary for providing our services. For instance, we only collect email addresses to facilitate account management and communication, and we do not require unnecessary details like phone numbers unless explicitly relevant. Users can choose to browse anonymously without creating an account, though this may limit access to personalized features like recommendations. Our privacy policy is reviewed and updated regularly to reflect changes in regulations or our practices, and users are notified of significant updates via email or in-app notifications.\n\n              If users have questions or concerns about their privacy, they can contact our dedicated Data Protection Officer at privacy@platform.com. We provide a user-friendly interface for submitting privacy-related requests, and our support team is available 24/7 to assist. We also maintain a detailed FAQ section on our website to address common privacy questions, such as how to opt out of data collection or request data deletion. Our goal is to empower users with full control over their personal information while delivering a high-quality, personalized experience.\n            `\n        }, {\n          section: 'Data Collection',\n          content: 'We collect data from movies.csv (movie metadata: movieId, title, genres), credits.csv (cast and crew: movieId, cast, crew), and TeluguMovies_enhanced.csv (Telugu movie metadata: movieId, title, genres, language) to analyze movie trends and improve recommendations. Data is sourced from internal datasets and anonymized to protect user privacy.'\n        }, {\n          section: 'Data Usage',\n          content: `\n              The data we collect is used to enhance the functionality and user experience of our platform. Our primary goal is to deliver personalized content, such as movie recommendations tailored to individual user preferences. By analyzing user interactions, such as search queries, clicks, and viewing history, we can suggest movies that align with your interests, making your experience more engaging and enjoyable. For example, if you frequently watch action movies, our algorithms prioritize action titles in your recommendations.\n\n              We also use collected data to improve the overall performance and features of our platform. This includes optimizing search functionality, refining recommendation algorithms, and enhancing the user interface. For instance, we analyze aggregate data to identify popular genres or trending movies, which helps us curate featured content sections. Data-driven insights allow us to introduce new features, such as advanced filtering options or personalized playlists, based on user behavior and feedback.\n\n              Analytics is another key use of our data. We aggregate and anonymize data to generate reports on platform usage, such as which genres are most popular in specific regions or how users navigate our interface. These reports are used internally to guide development decisions and externally for market research, but they never include personally identifiable information. For example, we might share that “60% of users in a region prefer Telugu movies,” but no individual user data is disclosed.\n\n              To ensure data security, all processing is conducted in a secure environment. Data in transit is protected with SSL/TLS encryption, and data at rest is stored in encrypted databases using AES-256 standards. Access to user data is strictly controlled, with role-based permissions ensuring only authorized personnel can view or process it. We conduct regular security assessments and penetration testing to maintain a robust defense against potential threats.\n\n              We do not sell user data or share it with data brokers. Any data shared with third parties, such as analytics providers or cloud infrastructure partners, is anonymized and limited to what is necessary for the service. For example, we may share anonymized viewing trends with a partner to improve recommendation accuracy, but this data cannot be traced back to individual users. Users can opt out of non-essential data sharing through their account settings at any time.\n\n              Our platform also uses data for fraud prevention and compliance purposes. For instance, we may analyze usage patterns to detect and prevent unauthorized account access or suspicious activity. This helps protect both our users and the integrity of our services. In cases where data is shared for fraud prevention, such as with payment processors, we ensure compliance with privacy laws and limit sharing to the minimum required.\n\n              We are committed to responsible data usage, adhering to principles of data minimization and purpose limitation. This means we only process data necessary for the intended purpose and do not retain it longer than needed. For example, browsing history used for recommendations is retained for a limited period (e.g., 90 days) unless the user opts to keep it longer. Users can request data deletion at any time, and we comply promptly, typically within 30 days, as required by GDPR and CCPA.\n\n              Our recommendation algorithms are designed to be fair and transparent. We avoid biases that could skew recommendations, such as over-prioritizing certain genres or regions, and we regularly audit our algorithms to ensure fairness. Users can view the basis for their recommendations (e.g., “Based on your interest in action movies”) and adjust their preferences to refine the results. We do not use data for automated decision-making that produces legal or significant effects without human oversight.\n\n              To support continuous improvement, we may conduct A/B testing or user surveys, using anonymized data to evaluate new features or designs. Participation in such activities is optional, and users can opt out without affecting their access to core services. We also invest in research to advance recommendation technologies, but all research data is anonymized and aggregated to protect user privacy.\n\n              If users have concerns about how their data is used, they can contact our Data Protection Officer at privacy@platform.com. We provide clear instructions for managing data preferences, including opting out of personalization or deleting data. Our privacy policy is updated regularly to reflect changes in our practices or regulations, and users are notified via email or in-app alerts. Our commitment is to use data responsibly to deliver a personalized, secure, and enjoyable experience while respecting user privacy.\n            `\n        }]);\n      }\n    };\n    fetchPolicy();\n  }, []);\n  const fetchCsvData = filename => {\n    // Simulate CSV data with more rows since no API endpoint exists\n    const fallbackData = filename === 'movies.csv' ? {\n      csv: `movieId,title,genres\n1,Toy Story (1995),Animation|Adventure|Comedy\n2,Jumanji (1995),Adventure|Family|Fantasy\n3,Grumpier Old Men (1995),Comedy|Romance\n4,Waiting to Exhale (1995),Drama|Romance\n5,Father of the Bride Part II (1995),Comedy|Family\n6,Heat (1995),Action|Crime|Drama\n7,Sabrina (1995),Comedy|Romance\n8,Tom and Huck (1995),Adventure|Family\n9,Sudden Death (1995),Action|Thriller\n10,GoldenEye (1995),Action|Adventure|Thriller\n11,American President, The (1995),Comedy|Drama|Romance\n12,Dracula: Dead and Loving It (1995),Comedy|Horror`\n    } : filename === 'credits.csv' ? {\n      csv: `movieId,cast,crew\n1,Tom Hanks|Tim Allen,John Lasseter\n2,Robin Williams|Kirsten Dunst,Joe Johnston\n3,Walter Matthau|Jack Lemmon,Howard Deutch\n4,Whitney Houston|Angela Bassett,Forest Whitaker\n5,Steve Martin|Diane Keaton,Charles Shyer\n6,Al Pacino|Robert De Niro,Michael Mann\n7,Harrison Ford|Julia Ormond,Sydney Pollack\n8,Jonathan Taylor Thomas|Brad Renfro,Mark S.

We collect various types of personal data to provide a personalized and seamless experience for our users. This includes, but is not limited to, email addresses, user preferences, browsing history, search queries, and interaction data such as clicks and time spent on specific content. We may also collect demographic information, such as age or location, if voluntarily provided by users during account creation or profile updates. All data collection is conducted with explicit user consent, obtained through clear and accessible opt-in mechanisms. Users are informed about the purpose of data collection at the point of entry, ensuring full transparency.\r\n\r\n              Our data collection practices adhere strictly to global privacy regulations, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United States. We ensure that users have the right to access, rectify, or delete their personal data at any time. Requests for data access or deletion are processed promptly, typically within 30 days, as required by law. We also provide users with the ability to opt out of non-essential data collection, such as targeted recommendations, through account settings. Users can manage their privacy preferences at any time, and changes are applied immediately.\r\n\r\n              To protect user data, we implement robust security measures. All personal information is encrypted both in transit (using SSL/TLS protocols) and at rest (using AES-256 encryption). Access to personal data is restricted to authorized personnel only, and all employees undergo regular training on data protection best practices. We conduct periodic security audits to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities. In the unlikely event of a data breach, we have a comprehensive incident response plan to notify affected users and regulatory authorities promptly, in compliance with applicable laws.\r\n\r\n              We do not share personal data with third parties for marketing purposes without explicit user consent. Any data shared with trusted partners, such as cloud service providers or analytics platforms, is anonymized to prevent identification of individual users. For example, we may share aggregated data (e.g., “80% of users prefer action movies”) to improve our services or conduct market research, but this data cannot be linked to specific individuals. Users can revoke consent for data sharing at any time through their account settings.\r\n\r\n              Our platform also respects user rights to data portability. Users can request a copy of their personal data in a structured, machine-readable format, enabling them to transfer it to another service if desired. We do not engage in automated decision-making or profiling that produces legal or significant effects on users without human oversight. For users under 16 (or the applicable age of consent in their jurisdiction), we require parental consent for data collection, verified through secure methods.\r\n\r\n              We are committed to minimizing data collection to what is strictly necessary for providing our services. For instance, we only collect email addresses to facilitate account management and communication, and we do not require unnecessary details like phone numbers unless explicitly relevant. Users can choose to browse anonymously without creating an account, though this may limit access to personalized features like recommendations. Our privacy policy is reviewed and updated regularly to reflect changes in regulations or our practices, and users are notified of significant updates via email or in-app notifications.\r\n\r\n              If users have questions or concerns about their privacy, they can contact our dedicated Data Protection Officer at privacy@platform.com. We provide a user-friendly interface for submitting privacy-related requests, and our support team is available 24/7 to assist. We also maintain a detailed FAQ section on our website to address common privacy questions, such as how to opt out of data collection or request data deletion. Our goal is to empower users with full control over their personal information while delivering a high-quality, personalized experience.\r\n            `,\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            section: 'Data Collection',\r\n            content:\r\n              'We collect data from movies.csv (movie metadata: movieId, title, genres), credits.csv (cast and crew: movieId, cast, crew), and TeluguMovies_enhanced.csv (Telugu movie metadata: movieId, title, genres, language) to analyze movie trends and improve recommendations. Data is sourced from internal datasets and anonymized to protect user privacy.',\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            section: 'Data Usage',\r\n            content: `\r\n              The data we collect is used to enhance the functionality and user experience of our platform. Our primary goal is to deliver personalized content, such as movie recommendations tailored to individual user preferences. By analyzing user interactions, such as search queries, clicks, and viewing history, we can suggest movies that align with your interests, making your experience more engaging and enjoyable. For example, if you frequently watch action movies, our algorithms prioritize action titles in your recommendations.\r\n\r\n              We also use collected data to improve the overall performance and features of our platform. This includes optimizing search functionality, refining recommendation algorithms, and enhancing the user interface. For instance, we analyze aggregate data to identify popular genres or trending movies, which helps us curate featured content sections. Data-driven insights allow us to introduce new features, such as advanced filtering options or personalized playlists, based on user behavior and feedback.\r\n\r\n              Analytics is another key use of our data. We aggregate and anonymize data to generate reports on platform usage, such as which genres are most popular in specific regions or how users navigate our interface. These reports are used internally to guide development decisions and externally for market research, but they never include personally identifiable information. For example, we might share that “60% of users in a region prefer Telugu movies,” but no individual user data is disclosed.\r\n\r\n              To ensure data security, all processing is conducted in a secure environment. Data in transit is protected with SSL/TLS encryption, and data at rest is stored in encrypted databases using AES-256 standards. Access to user data is strictly controlled, with role-based permissions ensuring only authorized personnel can view or process it. We conduct regular security assessments and penetration testing to maintain a robust defense against potential threats.\r\n\r\n              We do not sell user data or share it with data brokers. Any data shared with third parties, such as analytics providers or cloud infrastructure partners, is anonymized and limited to what is necessary for the service. For example, we may share anonymized viewing trends with a partner to improve recommendation accuracy, but this data cannot be traced back to individual users. Users can opt out of non-essential data sharing through their account settings at any time.\r\n\r\n              Our platform also uses data for fraud prevention and compliance purposes. For instance, we may analyze usage patterns to detect and prevent unauthorized account access or suspicious activity. This helps protect both our users and the integrity of our services. In cases where data is shared for fraud prevention, such as with payment processors, we ensure compliance with privacy laws and limit sharing to the minimum required.\r\n\r\n              We are committed to responsible data usage, adhering to principles of data minimization and purpose limitation. This means we only process data necessary for the intended purpose and do not retain it longer than needed. For example, browsing history used for recommendations is retained for a limited period (e.g., 90 days) unless the user opts to keep it longer. Users can request data deletion at any time, and we comply promptly, typically within 30 days, as required by GDPR and CCPA.\r\n\r\n              Our recommendation algorithms are designed to be fair and transparent. We avoid biases that could skew recommendations, such as over-prioritizing certain genres or regions, and we regularly audit our algorithms to ensure fairness. Users can view the basis for their recommendations (e.g., “Based on your interest in action movies”) and adjust their preferences to refine the results. We do not use data for automated decision-making that produces legal or significant effects without human oversight.\r\n\r\n              To support continuous improvement, we may conduct A/B testing or user surveys, using anonymized data to evaluate new features or designs. Participation in such activities is optional, and users can opt out without affecting their access to core services. We also invest in research to advance recommendation technologies, but all research data is anonymized and aggregated to protect user privacy.\r\n\r\n              If users have concerns about how their data is used, they can contact our Data Protection Officer at privacy@platform.com. We provide clear instructions for managing data preferences, including opting out of personalization or deleting data. Our privacy policy is updated regularly to reflect changes in our practices or regulations, and users are notified via email or in-app alerts. Our commitment is to use data responsibly to deliver a personalized, secure, and enjoyable experience while respecting user privacy.\r\n            `,\r\n          },\r\n        ]);\r\n      }\r\n    };\r\n    fetchPolicy();\r\n  }, []);\r\n\r\n  const fetchCsvData = (filename) => {\r\n    // Simulate CSV data with more rows since no API endpoint exists\r\n    const fallbackData = filename === 'movies.csv'\r\n      ? {\r\n          csv: `movieId,title,genres\r\n1,Toy Story (1995),Animation|Adventure|Comedy\r\n2,Jumanji (1995),Adventure|Family|Fantasy\r\n3,Grumpier Old Men (1995),Comedy|Romance\r\n4,Waiting to Exhale (1995),Drama|Romance\r\n5,Father of the Bride Part II (1995),Comedy|Family\r\n6,Heat (1995),Action|Crime|Drama\r\n7,Sabrina (1995),Comedy|Romance\r\n8,Tom and Huck (1995),Adventure|Family\r\n9,Sudden Death (1995),Action|Thriller\r\n10,GoldenEye (1995),Action|Adventure|Thriller\r\n11,American President, The (1995),Comedy|Drama|Romance\r\n12,Dracula: Dead and Loving It (1995),Comedy|Horror`,\r\n        }\r\n      : filename === 'credits.csv'\r\n      ? {\r\n          csv: `movieId,cast,crew\r\n1,Tom Hanks|Tim Allen,John Lasseter\r\n2,Robin Williams|Kirsten Dunst,Joe Johnston\r\n3,Walter Matthau|Jack Lemmon,Howard Deutch\r\n4,Whitney Houston|Angela Bassett,Forest Whitaker\r\n5,Steve Martin|Diane Keaton,Charles Shyer\r\n6,Al Pacino|Robert De Niro,Michael Mann\r\n7,Harrison Ford|Julia Ormond,Sydney Pollack\r\n8,Jonathan Taylor Thomas|Brad Renfro,Mark S.
